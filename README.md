**What is this?**

A 'renamed' fork of Uber Emulator that powers the Habbo Hotel R59 client. I have decompiled this source code and fixed it up.



*My changes include...*

- ...removing the backdoors in [this](https://github.com/Quackster/HolographR59/commit/aaad0841494b36768b553260402c6b76421ea292) commit.
- ...moved it from .NET Framework 4 to .NET 8 (multi-OS support!).
- ...fixed the references to stockimp.dll and MySql.Data.dll
- ...translating the start up to English
